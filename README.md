Research on arithmetic skill emergence in language models, extending lm-evaluation-harness

# Arithmetic skill emergence in language models

This repository extends the [EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) to study emergence patterns in arithmetic tasks. The work investigates whether emergence patterns observed empirically in arithmetic tasks exhibit similar power-law behavior to that found in theoretically tractable systems.

## Overview

This project builds upon lm-evaluation-harness and includes:

1. Fixed spacing bug in arithmetic tasks (see [Issue #2695](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/issues/2695))
2. Extended arithmetic task suite for studying skill emergence
3. Analysis tools for emergence patterns
